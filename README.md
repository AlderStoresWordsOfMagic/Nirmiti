# Nirmiti

Nirmiti serves as a library for FTL modding, containing Lua logic used throughout all of my mods as well as the means to implement them. Additionally, it is set up in a way that makes copying and pasting the code directly into your own projects as smooth as possible.

Though much of the library was built as a spiritual successor to Vertex, inheriting many of its features, it also comes bundled with several new capabilities such as regenerating energy shields, manual shield popping, and complex crew behavior, all of which can be interfaced with using XML tags. Nirmiti's Wiki tab contains more information on how to use its features.
